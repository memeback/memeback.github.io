There are groups out there who are crusading to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.les.aston.ac.uk/sss/sssao.html">simplify English spelling</a>, arguing that a thousand years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1179/histlang.html">language change</a> (not to mention a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~gene/languages/vowelshift.html">significant vowel shift</a>) has caused English orthography to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.les.aston.ac.uk/sss/sss6ax.html">fail</a> at its mission: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/goldsmith/phono1/Flaps.html">representing sounds</a>.  Hidden in the spelling brouhaha is another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Troy/1642/ogden.html">potentially brilliant</a> idea: a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://www.diac.com/~entente/basicpg.html">simplified version of English</a> that can be used as an international language, much like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100929160510/http://geography.about.com/education/geography/library/weekly/aa032300a.htm?rnk=r&amp;terms=esperanto">Esperanto</a> but with a built-in user base.
