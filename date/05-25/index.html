<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://dir.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/05/phantom_edit/index.html">The Phantom Edit</a>":
a re-edit of George Lucas'

crappy</a>
1999 "Star Wars" trilogy prequel.  This labor of love by an (at the time)
anoymous fan removes much of the hated Jar Jar, redubs the aliens
with better (and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.hws.edu/news/update/showrelease.asp?id=615">less
racist</a>) dialog and,
overall, did what Lucas' millions of dollars could not: make it watchable.
More importantly, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://starwars.wikicities.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit">"The Phantom
Edit"</a> was the first so-called fan edit
to make it beyond the tight knit circle of blackmarket dub vendors
at sci-fi conventions.

A more recent, and in hindsight inevitable, re-edit is 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.fulldls.com/downloading_movies_380">"Matrix Dezionized"</a> which
combines the episodes 2 and 3 of the "Matrix" trilogy 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://forums.matrixfans.net/showthread.php?t=26681">in order</a> to
eliminate some fan-hated scenes (most notably the post-apocalyptic
rave) including nearly every mention Zion, and some (but not nearly
enough) of the incoherent, three-bong-hit philosophy of the Warchoski
brothers.

Other, more obscure fanedits, such as 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.originaltrilogy.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=5310">"Star Trek VII: Kirkless Generations"</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3360338">"27 days later"</a>,

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3482036&amp;fl">"Jailbird"</a>
(an edit of "Con Air") 
and, oddly enough, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.mininova.org/tor/241286">"13 Going On 30: Extra Flirty"</a>


follow the same pattern:
disliked scenes are removed, dialog is changed (where possible) and
action is tightened.
Perhaps the most obscure, and least watchable, is 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.torrentreactor.to/torrents/view_49886">"Hannibalized"</a>,
a amateur re-edit of Ridley Scott's slasher flick "Hannibal".  Claiming
to have "more Hannibal and less Starling", this edit removed all the
scenes that made softened Hannibal Lecter's character, many of the
character building scenes involving Clarice Starling, and re-included
some of Scott's deleted scenes, such as the infamous 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060525120000/http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/h/hannibal.shtml">steering
wheel licking</a> scene.
