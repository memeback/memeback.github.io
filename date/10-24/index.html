        <div class="content">So I was thinking, hey, a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www-wilson.ucsd.edu/education/gchem/statesofmatter/stgold.html">cubic</a> 
inch of 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.occultopedia.com/a/alchemy.htm">gold</a>
would look pretty good on
my shelf. How much would that cost?
Answer: 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Au/phys.html">Gold weighs 19.3 grams/cc.</a> 
A 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.webcom.com/legacysy/convert2/volume.html">cubic inch is 16.4 cc.</a>
There are 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.webcom.com/legacysy/convert2/mass.html">31.1 grams in an ounce</a>
-- those are 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/jeffplan.htm">troy ounces</a>, 
remember.
And, as I write this, the
plain-metal 
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.onlygold.com/GlossaryPages/Glossary_FullScreenView.htm">"spot"</a>) 
price of gold is
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.kitco.com/market/">$270.50 per ounce</a>.
(A
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.kitco.com/gold.sellbar.html">bit more</a>
as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.onlygold.com/LoateCoinsMenu/MainMenu_LocateCoins.htm">coins</a>
or
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.onlygold.com/CoinDisplayPages/Combined_Coins/OneOunceCoinsFullScreen.asp">ingots</a>.)
Multiply it out, and my little paperweight would cost about 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.missioncreep.com/slackjaw/more/cheapest.html">$2750.</a>
Which is, weirdly, almost exactly the same price as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.apple.com/powermaccube">another little cubical paperweight</a>... 
(with 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001024120000/http://www.apple.com/displays/asd15/">sexy display</a>).
