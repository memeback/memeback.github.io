which can imitate human conversation (over a limited domain) fairly well.
However, another, less well-known, program called
Racter
once 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000928120000/http://eblong.com/zarf/markov/">wrote</a>
(or at least
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000928120000/http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/racterfaq.html">helped to write</a>)
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000928120000/http://qru.com/studio/tech/tips/12.htm">whole book</a>.
This collection of stories and poems, "The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed," was published
in 1984 under the amusing pen-name of
"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000928120000/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/Markov_chain.html">Mark V. Cheney</a>" (later changed to "Racter").
