        <div class="content">The Native American-based peyote religion is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://peyote.org/">deeply revered and sacred tradition</a> that stretches back through millennia, with its roots going back long before the drug was banned as a Schedule 1 Narcotic in 1970. While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://www.peyote.net/law.htm">exemptions against peyote prosecution</a> were set for the Native American Peyote Church, these are being ignored, or loopholes are being found around them, by antidrug zealots who are now firmly ensconced in high positions of power. Members of the Peyote Church are now being harrassed: the leader of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://www.peyote.net/welcome.html">Peyote Foundation</a> in Arizona recently had his landlord threatened, and thus he and his wife were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://www.peyote.net/#landlord">driven from their home</a>.  Because peyote is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/pychurch.htm">definitely a sacrament</a> as opposed to being a recreational party drug, this is an egregious offense against the American value of religious freedom - and many people - regardless of their feelings about drugs, feel that this oppression of individuals communing with their Creator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010610120000/http://www.petitiononline.com/TPF/petition.html">should end</a>.</div>
