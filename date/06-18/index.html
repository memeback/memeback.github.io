offering a 2.5 million share IPO to raise some desperately needed cash. What's
unusual is that they are offering the deal not through conventional IPO shops like 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990618120000/http://www.csfb.com/">First Boston</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990618120000/http://www.gs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> 
but the newly-formed boutique <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990618120000/http://www.wrhambrecht.com/">W.R. Hambrecht &amp; Co</a>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990618120000/http://www.openipo.com/OpenIPO/base/HIWorks/HIW4.html?REF=HIW4">
Dutch Auction</a>. Although the Dutch Auction is hailed as an equalizing process that allows 
non-institutional investors to acquire shares at the offering prices, detractors suggest that 
allowing the <i>hoi polloi</i> to bid away the typical first-day runup of hot IPOs will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990618120000/http://www.observer.com/cgi-win/homepage.exe?nyo1/BE050399">
kill significant demand from the speculators and momentum traders that flock to money-losing Internet 
IPOs in the first place</a>.
