        <div class="content">David Fincher's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000729120000/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800018964">Fight Club</a> is the first movie that does more than equal the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000729120000/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805062971/o/qid=964907728/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_3/104-3449064-6123959">novel</a> it's based on, supplanting it entirely.  Not a single idea is lost in the translation, and we are treated to new wrinkles (homosexual subtext) and juicy visual metaphors (insomniac flashes of Tyler as the only warm color against a sea of cool).  And hey, have you noticed Act I is reminiscent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000729120000/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800074753">Harold &amp; Maude</a>, Act II of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000729120000/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800047204">The Chocolate War</a>?  And both films star Bud Cort?  Which I'm sure is coincidence.  I mean, even if I'm too afraid to watch another Cort film rumored to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000729120000/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=3650&amp;buy=open&amp;Tab=reviews&amp;CID=19#tabs">disquieting similarities</a> to Fight Club's Act III, that wouldn't, you know, reveal a flaw in my comforting self-delusions, right?  [nervous laughter]  When I asked Tyler about it he made a disparaging remark about my cleverness and artfully changed the subject by punching me in the face.</div>
