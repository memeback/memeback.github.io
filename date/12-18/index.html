is one of the leading researchers of 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.inhousepub.co.za/sajv7n3/SAJarticle5_v7n3.htm">phantom limb pain</a>. 
Scientists used to think the reason people experienced pain in their amputated
limbs was because of nerves that were not fully severed, and would 
do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/biomed/his/PainExhibit/panel4.htm">
further amputations</a> to treat the problem. (Which didn't help at all). 

Through his research, Ramachandran discovered that what was
actually happening was that the brain's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.macalester.edu/~psych/whathap/UBNRP/Phantom/homunculus.html">
map</a> of the body was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.macalester.edu/~psych/whathap/UBNRP/Phantom/Ramachandran.html">
incorrectly remapped.</a>
After publishing his theory, he started getting all kinds of 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mind/notebook.html">letters</a>
from people, including some very 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mind/note_nf3.html">
weird</a> ones about people who experience orgasms in their feet (which
might explain
where
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://cincinnati.com/freetime/strange/032000_strange.html">foot fetishes</a>
come from). 

While working with one patient, Ramachandran came up with a very ingenious 
solution using a simple configuration of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011218120000/http://www.stanford.edu/~pmcheng/medarticles/WEIRDARM.txt">
mirrors</a> to teach the brain the correct mappings.
