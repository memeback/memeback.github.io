        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990909120000/http://www.transmetropolitan.com/">Transmetropolitan</a> is, in my ever-so-humble opinion, hands down the best comic book still being published regularly.  I would urge everyone to go buy it, even if you don't usually read comic books. Also, its writer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990909120000/http://www.warrenellis.com/"> Warren Ellis</a> has his own web site, which is pretty mod.</div>

        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990909120000/http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/4375/"> Velvet: The Unusual Superheroine</a> isn't about  mindless sex and senseless violence; it's about comprehensive writing. You can tell because it says so right there on the web page. Still, I do have to wonder how the author can "portray Velvet in a very respectable manner" in such a skimpy costume.</div>
