This is especially true of the tech industry, where everyone is scrambling to look like an insider, even if they heard about it only a month ago.

        <div class="content">Jack Chick translates and localizes his tracks, 
with some odd results.  His most famous
tract, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990817120000/http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0001/0001_01.asp">This Was Your Life</a>
has a couple of iconic scenes, the introductory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990817120000/http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0001/0001_01.asp">rich guy</a>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990817120000/http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0001/0001_13.asp">examination of conscience scene</a>.
Chick apparently subcontracts out the localization jobs, 
leading to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990817120000/http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/ReadTractHTB.asp?Title=This+Was+Your+Life%21&amp;StockNumber=401&amp;Page=9&amp;LastPage=zhGeneral%2Egif">cosmic perspective</a> and

Chinese Version.  Apparently, the quality of the
subcontracts vary, since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990817120000/http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1603/1603_01.asp">Farsi</a>
