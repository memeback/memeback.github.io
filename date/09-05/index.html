      <h2>1999</h2>

        <div class="content">I grew up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990905120000/http://www.samoyed.com/">Samoyed</a>,
as did my mother.  The one I grew up with was an adorable, 
sweet-tempered, clown of a dog,
like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990905120000/http://photo.net/photo/george.html">most Samoyeds</a> are.
He was a puppy into his last days..

The one mom grew up with was a terror, which is rare for the breed. Someday I'll 
put her tales of that dog on the Web. Until then, you'll have to suffer with a
Samoyed's own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990905120000/http://www.ngb.cx/tyler/tylersviewpoint.htm">story</a>.
(OK, so that's hokey. But Samoyeds ARE that goofy.)

        <div class="content">At first glance, you might think the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000905120000/http://www.foca.co.uk/">Formula One Cartoon Archive</a> just doesn't seem funny because you don't know enough about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000905120000/http://www.f1sportsweb.com/news.asp">Formula One racing</a>.  But the fact is that even if you do know a lot about it, the cartoons therein are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000905120000/http://www.foca.co.uk/foca97/f9709.html">profoundly unfunny</a>.  The only thing that struck a note with me was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000905120000/http://www.foca.co.uk/teams.html">strangely surreal list of drivers</a>.</div>
