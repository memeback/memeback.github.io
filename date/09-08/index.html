        <div class="content">It's amazing all the comic strips that are available online now.  You
can catch up on Alison Bechdel's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990908120000/http://www.comicazee.com/cartoonist.asp?id=9"> Dykes to Watch
Out For</a>, previously only seen in bound collections and
"alternative" papers.  Barbara Branson is for some reason, categorized
as an "editorial cartoonist" for her incredible strip, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990908120000/http://www.uexpress.com/ups/opinion/cartoon/bb/">Where I'm
Coming From</a>.  On the other hand, there's nothing like the
perverse, often hideously offensive, usually ironic cartoons of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990908120000/http://www.callahanonline.com/">John Callahan</a>. Make sure you
read his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990908120000/http://www.callahanonline.com/calhat.html">hate mail</a>. And
for a truly weird time, you may not be able to read Jim's Journal
online anymore but you can still play with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990908120000/http://spleen.mit.edu/cgi-bin/jim">Jim's Journal Strip
