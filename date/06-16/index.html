However, Bournemouth University's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://dec.bournemouth.ac.uk/drhw_lib/">Dynamically Reconfigurable Hardware Library</a> points out Stanford's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://umunhum.stanford.edu/res_html/darpa/adaptive.html">Adaptive Computing</a>, Berkeley's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/brass/">BRASS</a>, and MIT's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/raw/">RAW</a> are providing a rigourous analysis of the challenges involved.

        <div class="content">Sure, everyone seems to be offering free, web-based email these days, from 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://www.publicenemymail.com/default.asp">rap groups</a> to 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://www.altavista.net/">search engines</a>. But how many of them allow
you to check your email without even using a computer? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://www.mytalk.com/">MyTalk</a> does, with an 800-number, voice-mail style 
login that allows you to check your mail even when you are away from a computer. 
But then again, how many memepool readers are ever away from a computer

        <div class="content">Every heterosexual man alive has suffered, at least once, the gut-turning experience of 
falling in love with a female acquaintance, only to have his heartfelt confession rebuffed 
by the six most horrible words in the English language: "I just want to be friends." 
Joe Loong's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990616120000/http://www.wizard.net/~joelogon/platonic/">Foolproof Guide to 
Making Any Woman Your Platonic Friend</a> is, at turns, a hilarious and heart breaking
account of the unintented (good God, I hope unintended) grief that the women
in our lives visit upon us in the name of love, friendship, and other bullshit.
