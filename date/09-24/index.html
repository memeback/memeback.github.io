Wood</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.designwest.com/Johanna/womble/">Wombles</a> (Not to
be confused, naturally, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.wombleaction.mrnice.net/">other Wombles)</a>.  The
Wombles are - depending on what source I
look at - appear to be either bear-like things or rodent-like
things.  They started as children's fiction, apparently, and became
recording artists.  Roy Wood, on
the other hand, was a founder and main songwriter for the incredibly
influential band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.themoveonline.com/frame.html">The
Move</a>.  Both have done songs about Christmas:  Roy - "I Wish
It Could Be Christmas Every Day"(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.cix.co.uk/~rsamuel/wizzard/midifile/xmasgm.mid" in="" midi<="" a="">),
Wombles - "Wombling Merry Christmas".  Now, due to... well,
some unknown force that we should all fear, we have </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.nofidelity.com/singles/the_wombles.html">"I Wish
It Could Be A Wombling Merry Christmas Everyday"</a>.  There's
even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.nofidelity.com/audio/thewomblesvideo.ram">video</a>.
What <em>really</em> frightens me is that I'm considering getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010924120000/http://www.roywood.co.uk/!womblecdreview.html">the CD</a>.
