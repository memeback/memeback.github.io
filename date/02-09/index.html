        <div class="content">I sit on the couch.  I watch TV.  But no matter what I do, I can't get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.system16.com/sega/mp3/Out%20Run%20-%20Magical%20Sound%20Shower.mp3">Magical Sound Shower</a>, one of the songs from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.mameworld.net/mameperf/games/o/outrun.html">Sega arcade game</a> OUT OF MY HEAD.  You can listen to it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.system16.com/sega/mp3.htm">The Arcade Museum</a>, if you dare.  I tried to find some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.lool.net/Game_Music/">other videogame music</a> to drive it out, and stumbled onto the "Party Remix" <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/nintendo/n64/saria.mid">(what the fuck?)</a> version of Saria's Song from the first N64 Zelda game, The Ocarina of Time, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.vgmusic.com/">vgmusic.com</a>.  If you can tolerate the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.blackbook.org/1996/08/960815.html">cheesiness of MIDI</a>, it's pretty neat.  Excuse me, I have to go listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209120000/http://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/sega/genesis/son1hill.mid">the theme to Sonic the Hedgehog</a> again and again and again and again...</div>
