Otto Preminger's attempt at an LSD picture, starring Jackie Gleason?
Frighteningly, I've actually seen it in a theater, but that's not the
point. (Sadly, I can't find a decent review on the web - try to find a
copy of Bad Movies We Love by Edward Margulies and Stephen Rebello, or
issue 6 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030508120000/http://members.aol.com/shockcin/main.html">Shock
Cinema</a>). Most fans of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030508120000/http://www.sci.fi/~solaris/kauris/main.html">Aki Kaurismaki</a>
have seen his film Leningrad Cowboys Go America. In fact, if you live
outside of Finland, it may be the <em>only</em> film of his you've seen
(although his latest was actually up for an oscar this year
- color me astounded). Few, however, have probably seen the sequel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030508120000/http://www.sci.fi/~solaris/kauris/lcmm.html">Leningrad Cowboys
Meet Moses</a>. I know I haven't, although I've wanted to. Somewhere in
between we find William Klein's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030508120000/http://members.aol.com/shockcin/freedom.html">Mister Freedom</a>
and the legendarily bad comic strip adaptation,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030508120000/http://movies.go.com/filmography/Credits?movie_id=15092">Dondi</a>
(Yet another film with no decent web review). Sadly, if you don't know
what you're looking for, the site is a nightmare to navigate. Thank
[insert diety here] for the search box. Still, for some of the oddities
here, it's worth the work.
