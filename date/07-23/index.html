        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://www.djvuzone.org/">DjVu</a>  is intended to be an all-encompassing document format. You can get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://sourceforge.net/projects/djvu">free version</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> or buy it from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://www.lizardtech.com/">LizardTech</a>. I find this very odd, as the most useful part, in my opinion, is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://www.djvuzone.org/wid/index.html">image compression technology</a>, which looks like it would be great for maps and especially aerial photos. That market is currently served nicely by another LizardTech product, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://www.lizardtech.com/solutions/geospatial/">MrSid</a>.
Indeed, LizardTech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://www.lizardtech.com/download/?f=0&amp;d=1">gives   away</a> various MrSid viewers and tools, but the image server software disappeared, taking along with it the tool which could be used to batch-decode images on Linux machines. For the hobbyist, product pricing is daunting, and hand-decoding isn't very useful, if the viewer software even supports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html">GeoTIFF</a> exports. At least someday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020723120000/http://gdal.velocet.ca/">GDAL</a> will likely support DjVu, which will ease the space requirements of keeping a personal cache of geodata.
