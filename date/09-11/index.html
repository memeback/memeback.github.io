Cicero's <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990911120000/http://patriot.net/~lillard/cp/cic.fin1.html">De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</a></cite>, sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33.
Look for the familiar bits
starting at "...neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit, amet, consectetur, adipisci
velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt, ut labore et dolore magnam
aliquam quaerat voluptatem.". 
("Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
 obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.")
Deep, huh?
