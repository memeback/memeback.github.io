        <div class="content">Until a few months ago, I had lost all faith in television. But then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990913120000/http://www.foodtv.com/">Food Network</a> brought me hope and fulfillment. Billed as "Ultimate Fighting Champion meets Julia Child", <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990913120000/http://www.foodtv.com/fn/programs/ironchef/index.htm">Iron Chef</a> is a dubbed &amp; subtitled show from Japan where every week a challenger must compete in Kitchen Stadium against one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990913120000/http://www.ironchef.com/ironchefs.html">Iron Chefs</a>, a select group of expert chefs. With much drama and fanfare, the Iron Chef and challenger then have 1 hour to create gourmet dishes celebrarting a theme ingredient. The unofficial fan site at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990913120000/http://www.ironchef.com/">IronChef.com</a> provides more info and episode summaries. In my opinion, this is by far the best show on television today.</div>
