        <div class="content">Now, some of you may have heard the recent news article (not urban legend) about a man who got an unlicensed doctor to cut his leg off to satisfy his amputation fetish.  Now, we all know that fetishes can be outright wacky and drive people to do really weird things, but, you may wonder, why would a doctor, even an unlicensed one, agree to participate?  Well, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000215120000/http://www.laweekly.com/">LA Weekly</a> has an article all about the bizarre and astounding life and practice of Dr. John Ronald Brown, which is appropriately entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000215120000/http://www.laweekly.com/ink/00/04/news-ciotti.shtml">"Why Did He Cut Off That Man's Leg?"</a>  It's not recommended for the squeamish (although there are, fortunately, no pictures of that or any of his past surgeries).</div>
