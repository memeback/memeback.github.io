        <div class="content">Let's face it: we all still like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a>, but you're no longer in the avant-garde for knowing about it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.mcsweeneys.net/">McSweeney's</a> will restore your sense of ahead-of-the-curveness in the humor market.  Besides the daily updates, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.mcsweeneys.net/archives/">archives</a> for some blisteringly funny articles, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.mcsweeneys.net/1999/01/20adolf.html">this</a> little essay on the next Graceland.</div>

The Nudist on the Late Shift</a> is out. Unlike most high tech writers who focus on 
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.kpcb.com/">movers and shakers</a>, Bronson introduces us to a 
cast of vivid unknowns seeking fame and fortune in the last arena of high-octane
capitalism. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990625120000/http://www.pobronson.com/questions.htm">Riddles of Superachieverland</a>, 
an online excerpt from the book, offers a concentrated dose of Bronson's style and anthropological perspective.
