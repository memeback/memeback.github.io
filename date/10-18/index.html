        <div class="content">I had access to cable television for five days last week. Every time I surfed past one of the Christian-identitified stations, it seemed I had a 50-50 chance of running into an ad, or preview <small><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://acw.activate.net/cbn/omega/100599-56.ram">(RealVideo)</a></small>, or behind-the-scenes promo for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://www.theomegacode.com/">The Omega Code</a>. With that kind of media blitz from its producers at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://www.tbn.org/">Trinity Broadcast Network</a>, perhaps it's not too suprising that the Revelations- and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://www.biblecode.com/">Bible Code</a>-based sci-fi flick had a #10 weekend opening on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://www.variety.com/">Variety</a>'s list. (Boffo BO in Oklahoma; the flick's only on 305 screens in the Bible Belt, Midwest, and southern California.)
However, doesn't having an Omega Code website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991018120000/http://www.microsoftstore.com/">www.microsoftstore.com</a> qualify as yet another sign of the Apocolypse?

Over the years the names of their creations have become household words: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/frisbee.html">Frisbee</a>...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/hulahoop.html">Hula Hoop</a>...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/superball.html">Superball</a>...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/hacky.html">Hacky Sack</a>. And unlike other toys of the past half-century which either disappeared into obscurity or collector's vaults, Wham-O's products continue to be manufactured and updated while still maintaining the charm of the originals. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/aliensplash.html">Wham-O's imaginative water toys</a> are perennial favourites. Recall that yellow Slip-n-Slide you belly-flopped on as a kid on the summer lawns of the seventies...and watch today's kids romp through various <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021018120000/http://www.wham-o.com/content/slipnslide.html">21st century versions</a>, which have grown tunnels, waterfalls, asteroid obstacles and tidal waves. Wham-O had been assimilated by the toy monolith, Mattel, in 1994...but a few years later, in a refreshing change of pace from the usual way of such things, they de-Borged themseves to become independent again.
