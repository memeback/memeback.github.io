and enjoying it.  The <em>ne plus ultra</em>
of historical fiction is Colleen McCullough's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991012120000/http://loki.stockton.edu/~roman/fiction/mccullough.htm">Masters

as another entry in the books-about-ancient-Rome category.
And, for completeness, I'll mention Robert Graves' fabulous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991012120000/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067972477X">
