        <div class="content">"PCs are like telephones, which also used to be huge objects that all
looked the same. The reason why the profit margins on the PC are so small
for so many manufacturers is that they've all concentrated on the same
thing: the CPU, the hard disk. People won't spend so much money on that
anymore. People want to feel the value of having

benefits, customers will pay for that."

        <div class="content">I've spent the last few months looking for the perfect laptop. This involves compulsively checking
with japanese importers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991217120000/http://www.jpd.com/">jpd</a> and

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991217120000/http://www.portablecomputing.com/">poorly written magazines</a>. While the SONY Vaio I mentioned earlier is an 
absolute steal at $1400, I think the most perfect of the perfect laptops today has to be
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991217120000/http://www.jpd.com/computers/biblomf.htm">Fujitsu Biblo MF40X</a>. Featuring an XGA 12.1" display, 3d accelerated graphics,
a 0.18 micron process Pentium III at 400mhz, and a modular bay that takes a DVD drive in a
svelte package that weighs between 3.7 and 4.5lbs. Unfortunately despite my letters, Fujitsu
only sells the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991217120000/http://www.fujitsu-pc.com/products/corp/sseries_frm.html">SVGA version</a> in the US, so you'll have to fork out $3800 to

featuring their trademark red eraserhead pointing device. If you occaisionally photoshop, there is a ps/2 port on
the back for a real mouse. However you'll be surprised how infrequently you'll move your arms away from the keyboard
and how much more physically connected you feel to your machine. I encourage you to switch
mouse button functionality between right and left buttons for optimal right handed trackpointing though.
If you reject pointing devices all together, then you should definitely go with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991217120000/http://commerce.www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce/SalesNav?partnum=92G7454&amp;cntry=840&amp;lang=en_US">IBM's AT Buckling-Spring Keyboard</a>.
