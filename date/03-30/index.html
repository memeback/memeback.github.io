      <article>
        <div class="content">Popularized by 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.acclarke.co.uk/">Arthur C. Clarke</a>
in his classic novel
"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.sbfonline.com/15b7.htm">The Fountains of Paradise</a>,"
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi859.htm">space elevator</a>
(also known as a "beanstalk") is basically a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/TETHER/spacetowers.html">big
cable</a> that stretches from the Earth's surface to 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/rocket_sci/satellites/geo-high.html">geosynchronous orbit</a>.
Why the hell would you want to do this?  Well, for one thing
it would make putting things in orbit extremely cheap.  
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.badastronomy.com/mad/1996/elevator.html">Problems</a>,
however, are legion.  It's uncertain whether 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SPBI1MA.HTM">any foreseeable
material</a> is even 
theoretically strong enough to support the weight of this enormous cable
(although 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/Nanotechnology/publications/1997/applications/#transportation">active materials</a> and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://cnst.rice.edu/aiche96.html">buckytubes</a> hold
promise).
Furthermore, the elevator would sweep
a path through near-Earth orbits, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.engaust.com.au/ew/1098spacejunk.html">further
crowding</a> orbital space.
And what would happen if the cable broke, and thousands of miles of
ultrastrong cable 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.cs.sandia.gov/projects/comet.html">slammed into the
Earth</a> at orbital velocities?
However, if we don't insist on our elevator reaching all the way from
the ground to orbit, it becomes 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://members.aol.com/beanstalkr/project/">more realistic</a>.
For example, an
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://members.aol.com/Nathan2go/SPELEV.HTM">orbital tether</a>
could be used to bridge the gap between "high altitute" and "near space"
and provide not only a cheaper route to orbit, but also a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000330120000/http://www.circling.org/features/mir.html">zero-gee tourist spot</a>.
