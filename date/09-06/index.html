        <div class="content">As many of you know, U.S. citizens do not vote directly in national elections - rather, we deliver our opinions through a labrynthine system known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990906120000/http://www.nara.gov/fedreg/proced.html">Electoral Colleges</a>. While the relative merits of Electoral Colleges have been the source of fierce academic debates, serious quantitative rigor remains alien to those schooled in Political Science. Consequently, most essays on the topic are eloquently-crafted polemics built upon poorly-constructed models riddled with questionable assumptions. In this arena, Will Hively's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990906120000/http://208.226.13.177/archive/output.cfm?ID=907">Math Against Tyranny</a> stands alone as a lively, <i>interesting</i> and quantitatively sound defense of Republic democracy.
