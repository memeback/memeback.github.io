        <div class="content">Jared Diamond went to New Guinea to study bird
evolution and wound up having
a conversation with a native
politician, who ended up asking him "Why did
Europeans develop so much cargo and bring it here,
while we people of New Guinea developed so little
of our own?"  Twenty-five years later, he 
presented his first attempt at an answer in a
book called 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981222120000/http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p1.html">Guns,
Germs, and Steel</a>.  The answer, before it
was done, had blown up into a history of the last
thirteen millennia of this planet.</div>

  The U.S. Army spent over 300 thousand dollars, to figure out a way for
  women to pee standing without wetting themselves. They concluded that it
  was not possible without the aid of a "funnel." They are wrong. By
  visiting this site *you* will learn something that the U.S. Army *still*
  doesn't know. (and it won't cost you a *thing*!)
