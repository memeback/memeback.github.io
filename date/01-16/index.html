        <div class="content">The new Federal law requiring U.S. schools and libraries to install censor software on all internet computers will go into effect this year, barring judicial interference.  It's a lot more serious than many people realize: the new law will not merely keep minors from seeing "indecent" sites; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.eff.org/censorship2000/20001222_eff_hr4577_statement.html">the law's stipulations</a> could encourage situations in which adults will be required to jump through an unbelievable array of hoops to get public librarians to switch off the filterware, and it proclaims swift and heavy-handed denial of vital federal funding to noncompliant libraries.  What's more, censorware doesn't just block <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.womens-erotica.com/headlesspenis/">sex</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://rotten.com/">violence</a>; most censorware companies have no qualms about their "sexless values" propaganda agendas. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.peacefire.org/">Peacefire</a>  pulled a "bait-and-switch" trick with the makers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/Cyber_Patrol/">CyberPatrol</a> which had some very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.peacefire.org/BaitAndSwitch/">telling results</a>.  Another censorware, CyberSITTER 2000, now features secret installation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.solidoak.com/news.htm">remote control</a> for spying on latchkey kids - or your spouse. It also inexplicably now features a category specifically blocking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://www.solidoak.com/cybfilters.htm">job search</a> sites. It will take more than slapping blue ribbon gifs on your pages to stop this menace; as usual, consult the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010116120000/http://eff.org/">foremost experts</a> on net freedom for more information. </div>
