        <div class="content">It's likely that quantum computing will, in the future, be a reality.However, making algorithms for
them is not going to be trivial as they don't function at all like our traditional digital computers.
To facilitate this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991126120000/http://www.openqubit.org/">Open Qubit</a> wants to emulate them.
The emulator won't run at nearly the speed of a real quantum computer, but it should at least be
helpful for developing algorithms before we finish developing the computers.</div>
