        <div class="content">As if UFO nuts couldn't get any wackier, along comes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990204120000/http://www.reptoids.com/">Reptoids.com</a>, lizard fetishists disguising as conspiracy buffs who believe that evil reptile aliens from another dimension live inside the earth and periodically come out ot exchange technology and drink our blood and form trilateral commissions or something like that.  Proof positive of this insidious plot can be seen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990204120000/http://www.reptoids.com/media.htm">Theodore Rex</a>, starring Whoopi Goldberg -- a propaganda film preparing us for the inevitable Reptoid invasion.  Sadly, the only weapon we have against these evil monsters is information from the brave freedom fighters running the web site.
