The robot has Bjork's features (again, photo realistic), which begin singing.

a Honda Odessey but like other of us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.naafa.org/">fat
folk</a> she was too big for the seat belt.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.saturn.com/">Most</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.chrysler.com/">other</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.volkswagen.com/">car</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.ford.com/">makers</a> offer seat belt extenders so
that everyone can safely strap in. Some offer them for free, some cost
no more than $30.  Elizabeth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.ifisher.com/hondacontacts.html">contacted Honda</a>
who has told her they will not make extenders.  Further research found
that while Hyundai and Subaru also do not make extenders, nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.ifisher.com/getbelts.htm">every other car maker</a>
does.  Elizabeth is trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.ifisher.com/nhtsa/">petition the NHTSB</a> to amend a
Federal US regulation that would require car manufacturers to make
seat belts or offer extenders to cover everyone, not just people who
weigh up to 215 lbs, as they do now.  Ironically, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/"> National Transportation Safety
Board</a> is big on it's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/buckleplan/">
Buckle Up America</a> program which encourages seatbelt use and offers
statistics showing how many lives are saved!
And while you might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000626120000/http://www.ifisher.com/disagree.html">not
agree</a> with this or just think this is just a "problem" for fat
