        <div class="content">Searching for music is not limited to finding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.midi.org/">MIDI</a> or audio files tagged with the text of interest. Searching by example, aka "More Like This," is potentially
a far more intuitive mechanism for retrieving content but is especially challenging in the audio domain.

However, until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/mpeg/">MPEG</a> has completed their specification <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/mpeg/standards/mpeg-7/mpeg-7.htm">MPEG-7</a> in 2001 July there will
not be a standard mechanism for creating searchable multimedia files.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.musclefish.com/">Muscle Fish LLC</a> is the 1992 offspring of four West Coast academics
who chose to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://164.195.100.11/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1='5918223'.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/5918223&amp;RS=PN/5918223">patent</a>
their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.musclefish.com/ieeemm96/index.html">sound classification</a> scheme in 1997. The most technically interesting feature is a statistical distance metric computed on fairly
well understood audio features used for speech recognition and synthesis.

Along similar lines, Carnegie Mellon student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dougb/">Doug Beeferman</a> developed a musical search algorithm that can index and retrieve find musically similar
files encoded in MIDI on the web with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/qpd/">QPD -- Query by Pitch Dynamics</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991121120000/http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/qpd/doc/html/">(detail)</a>.
