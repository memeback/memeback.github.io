gazillionaire? Conventional journalism will never reveal the devilish maze of nondisclosure/gag orders,
noncompete covenants and venture capital double-crosses that every entrepreneur must confront on 
the road to seemingly overnight IPO riches. That's why it's gratifying to see Bronson's

(Favorite moment from Basic Instinct, for which Eszterhas was paid $3 million: Sharon Stone's character writes a novel under a pen name to hide her identity, then thoughtfully includes her photo on the back cover.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000708120000/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305006563/o/qid=962851083/sr=8-2/ref=aps_sr_v_2_1/002-6827659-9030440">Burn Hollywood Burn</a> proves Eszterhas can write humor every bit as well as thrillers; the I was an hour in before I realized it was intended to be a comedy.
