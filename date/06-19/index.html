us that asking him why he believes the King James translation of the
bible is the <em>real</em> text is a "joke question" and
that his Jesus-promised girlfriend is a fast-food waitress in
Wisconsin, who has an unlisted number and who he can't visit because
he has no car - but we should give her his email address.  It must be
interesting on his planet...
