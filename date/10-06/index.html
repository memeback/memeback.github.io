        <div class="content">In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.legomindstorms.com/press/releases/1_98.html">1998</a> the international toy manufacturer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.lego.com/">LEGO</a> created a new "lego world" called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.legomindstorms.com/">Mindstorms</a>. Perhaps a revolution for the robotic hobbyist, the new product brought research from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT media lab</a> to the open market, its new form being the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://fredm.www.media.mit.edu/people/fredm/mindstorms/index.html">RCX</a>. 
A new, Open-Source operating system for the RCX called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.multimania.com/legos/">LeGOS</a> is definitely your best bet for a substitue when you get the hankering to tinker with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.crynwr.com/lego-robotics/">internals</a> of that yellow box.
The unofficial LEGO Mindstorms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://members.tripod.com/~ssncommunity/webrings/legoms_index.html">webring</a> is a high-quality collection of user-cum-fanatics all bringing their mindstorm oneness together. Some off-webring don't-miss projects include an award winning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.bea.hi-ho.ne.jp/meeco/biped/bipede.html">bipedal robot</a>, a turtle-like robot named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.plazaearth.com/usr/gasperi/walter.htm">walter</a> based on the 1950's work of W. Grey Walter, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.monumental.com/wesmat/lego/SyncroDrive/Syncro.html"> synchro drive mechanism</a> that permits zero-radius turning, and an ingenious (and patented) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.net-info.com/~dcarlson/">Tri-Star ATV</a> design.
In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.lego.com/technic/default.asp">Technic world</a>, there was already a burgeouning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.lugnet.com/technic/">fanbase</a> to develop new frontiers, but with Mindstorms a more sophisticated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.lugnet.com/robotics/">robotics-oriented</a> effort begun to take shape.
Don't forget to order your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.pitsco-legodacta-store.com/pld5/dir.icl?secid=10">spare parts</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://www.ee.nmt.edu/~jmathis/dacta.html">catalog scan</a>) for those big projects! And instead of that 18-toothed thingy, get the correct name and spec for that Technic part at the The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006120000/http://w3.one.net/~hughesj/technica/t_contents.html">technica registry</a> which is also swank poster-fodder.</div>

        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://www.station.sony.com/">Sony Online Entertainment's</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://www.everquest.com/">Everquest</a> is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/h_profile_zatozia.shtml">nasty</a> place. 

 Several locations feature gruesome implements of torture and severed heads.  

Elements of the gameplay require killing pregnant women.  But this is to be 

expected, Everquest is a fantasy roleplaying game in a setting with medieval 

overtones.  So why did Sony's Verant unit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://www.lumthemad.net/news/970718644,57681,.shtml">ban a player</a> for 

writing a piece of disturbing fan fiction about the game?  Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020716-5.html">first 

statement</a> on the matter suggested that they didn't want that kind of guy 

playing their game.  Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/021102.html">second 

statement</a> implied it was all about protecting their copyrights, but this smacks 

of legal damage control.  
The idea that a corporation 

can cut off a service because they don't like what you say is kind of chilling.  My 

response to all this? Sponsor the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier 

Foundation</a>.

But if you really want to call her up, she repeatedly mentions that she requires you to read a page describing an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/needs.htm">intricate, step by step ritual of efficiency </a> designed to screen out flakes and losers...as well as anyone who'd dare put his own needs above her slightest whims.  She also states that every other page on her site must be read, and she'll quiz you on them to make sure. Mary has been looking for her special someone for years now, and she'll probably be looking for many more years to come...considering that she'd  require her husband to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/chivalry.htm">get rid of his pets</a> (she sees them as competing with her for his attention) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/chivalry.htm">never ride a motorcycle again</a>, as well as quitting any job involving danger or travelling - and that's just for starters.  On top of that, yet another rule is that a would-be suitor must bring a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/needs.htm#gift">gift of money</a> to her before she'll even go ahead with the date...but that's solely to earn the privilege of being in her company: even though she's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/index.htm#atheist">not religious</a>, she's very adamantly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001006120000/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/mary1777/waiting.htm">against premarital sexual activity</a>.</div>
