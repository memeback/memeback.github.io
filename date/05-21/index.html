        <div class="content">Syndicated comics strips are generally so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000521120000/http://www.garfield.com/">awful</a> I'd begun to despair.  Turns out it's the syndication system, not the medium, that's poisoned.  People are publishing online in droves, including some of the best comics the world has ever seen.  For instance, Christopher Baldwin's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000521120000/http://www.brunostrip.com/bruno.html">Bruno</a> is a joyful, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000521120000/http://baldwinpage.com/hobbies/covers/">beautifully-drawn</a> and skillfully executed labor of love... basically the embodiment of why I liked comics in the first place (also art in general.  and life itself, really).  Plus, it gets beaucoup bonus points for being copublished in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000521120000/http://brunostrip.com/brunozebd/">French</a>.  Treat yourself and fulfill your hazy ambitions to make lifekind a teensy bit better at the same time: bolster the quotient of good mojo in the world by ordering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000521120000/http://www.moodycow.com/">Bruno stuff</a>.  <em>Magnifique!!</em> </div>
