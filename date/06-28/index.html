        <div class="content">In a <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000628120000/http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaone00/j1-00-bosak.html">Java</a>One</cite> interview, Jon Bosak ("<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000628120000/http://www.llnl.gov/das/das_admin/staff/teller.html">father</a> of XML") came <em>so close </em> to up and saying what I've been screaming for years -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000628120000/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198537379">SGML</a> is the biggest fucking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000628120000/http://www.csis.ul.ie/COBOL/">mess</a> that otherwise smart people ever came up with.

For example, he observes, delicately:
"You know, with SGML, after 13 years of implementation there were fewer than half a dozen SGML processors in the world, and with the single
exception of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000628120000/http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>'s, all of those processors had been constructed by efforts that were Department of Defense sized effort.
So you just look at that and you say, well, I guess that SGML is probably a little on the far side of the complexity we want." 

Gosh, a little, probably?
