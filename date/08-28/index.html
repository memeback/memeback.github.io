        <div class="content">Ok geek, thanks to the helpful links from memepool, your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990828120000/http://www.avatarme.com/">Metaverse avatar</a> is ready and you're busy building your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990828120000/http://www.3danarchy.com/">bandwidth-hogging 3DAnarchy home</a>. <i>But how's your sword-fighting skills, Deliverator?</i> "Kendo," as Snow Crash readers and 15th-century samurai know, is an attempt to take a disorganized, violent, brutal conflict and turn it into a cute game. Two choices: play with bokkens (wooden swords) at a "kendo" school, or study the original Nipponese art, sparring/training with steel blades, at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990828120000/http://www.shinkendo.com/">Shinkendo</a> dojo. Guess what <i>I've</i> been studying for the past three years.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010828120000/http://web.cetlink.net/~farrier/DCindex.html">DC comics</a>
cancelled 31 comic titles (while adding only 8
more).  This dramatic reduction in the number (and page count) of
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010828120000/http://www.yoner.com/awodcc/">DC comics</a> became known as the

(in reference to DC's own
"DC Explosion" ad campaign of a few years earlier).  Several of these
cancelled comics hadn't even been published yet, so to preserve their
copyright, DC put out a collection called the
