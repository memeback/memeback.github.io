Often, the vore fetish is intertwined with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://abraxa.0catch.com/">furry</a> fetishism. Other times, vore erotica is intimately tied with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.geocities.com/dvourer/stories.html">cannibalism</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.blackplague.org/lloyd/nekroe/lloyd/images-b/index.html">necrophilia</a>. Other voraphiliacs combine vore fetish with religious fetishism, leading to images of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://angel.1jh.com/gallery/angel/generated/cp.shtml">angels eating</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://angel.1jh.com/gallery/angel/generated/wv.shtml">being eaten</a> by a variety of other creatures. Yet others combine the Freudian sexual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.geocities.com/austinwolfclaw/vorepics.html">fetishism</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.blackplague.org/lloyd/a/images/we/erulian/set01.html">violence</a> with the Jungian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://internettrash.com/users/snake_man/index2.html">ouroboros symbolism</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.blackplague.org/lloyd/a/images/we/erulian/tn/buttfirst.jpg">serpentine</a> consumption and build <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021022120000/http://www.darklands.cx/~mryum/SAS.html">giant anamatronic snakes</a>.
