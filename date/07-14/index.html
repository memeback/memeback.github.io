        <div class="content">Lots of people in the United States have never
heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.mervynpeake.org/">Mervyn
Peake</a>.  He was an illustrator of
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.mervynpeake.org/Illustrator/Illustrator.html">various
literary classics</a>, but perhaps more importantly, he
authored a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.mervynpeake.org/Novelist/Novelist.html">trilogy</a>
of novels about the fantastic Castle Gormenghast and its
denizens, particularly
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gormenghast/std/char/titus.shtml">Titus</a>,
the 77th Earl of Groan,

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gormenghast/std/char/steerpike.shtml">Steerpike</a>.
I found out about this when I saw a preview

        <div class="content">One of the most beautifully drawn animated movies in years,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.geocities.com/~eddie_bowers/">The Thief And
The Cobbler</a>, was a labor of love by 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jimmyd/roger-rabbit/old-index.html">Who
Framed Roger Rabbit</a> animator
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.animag.com/news/2000/04/richard_williams.html">Richard
Williams</a>.
Way over schedule, the film was yanked away by Warner Brothers
(actually, by their
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.moviemaker.com/issues/36/thinklike/36_thinklike.html">bond
company</a>) and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.geocities.com/~eddie_bowers/develop.html">butchered</a>
to make it "more mainstream."
The worst offense -- worse than the cut footage or the utterly forgettable
songs -- is the jarring, painfully unfunny voiceover added to the
(silent) character of the thief by 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://www.ten97.com/SF/SFHost-Winters.htm">aging ham</a>,
Jonathan Winters.
<br>
There may be hope, though.  Recently, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000714120000/http://aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=5731">Williams
said</a> that there are plans for a release of his original (albeit
incomplete) version on DVD.
