        <div class="content">The newly-minted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990807120000/http://www.creators.com/comics/comprof/libmeado.asp">Liberty Meadows</a> is a delightful comic starring a neurotically insecure protagonist and his persistently bungled attempts to connect with an out-of-his-league attractive female love interest - along with an eccentric cast of deranged talking animals.
