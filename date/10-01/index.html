        <div class="content">One manner of trying to assess the good or harm of political policy is to examine incidents that act as examples of actions that a policy advocates. Videos from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001120000/http://www.hk94.com/weblog/?p=62">military operations</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001120000/http://www.libertynews.org/wtc/">tragedies</a> provide evidece to spark discussion of such incidents. However, depending on one's intent, the collecting of such <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001120000/http://www.fobiopatel.com/dongles/archives/2004/05/nick_berg_danie.php">videos</a> may itself be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001120000/http://www.twin-towers.net/news.htm">morally objectionable</a>. Another important problem is that the veracity of these videos is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001120000/http://arsenal.media.mit.edu/memes/incidents/jetengine.avi">sometimes questionable</a>.
