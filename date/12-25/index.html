        <div class="content">One can be disabused of the notion that the Brothers Grimm and Walt Disney had the fairytale market cornered by reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991225120000/http://www.g-world.org/magictales/home.html">Magic Tales of Mexico</a>.  For instance, there's a great many similarities between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991225120000/http://www.g-world.org/magictales/blancaflor.html">"Blanca Flor"</a> and another famous story just about all children have read, have had read to them, or have at least seen on video.

It uses a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031225120000/http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=41734">war metaphor</a>. What really sets it apart is that, in a very forward move for a Disney movie and as a VD awareness movie, it mentions transmission through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031225120000/http://www.illegal-art.org/video/mpeg/vd_attack_plan.mpeg">homosexual intercourse</a> as well as heterosexual intercourse.
