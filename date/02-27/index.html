It has been reliably documented at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030227120000/http://lencole.home.sprynet.com/oarfish.htm">eight meters</a>, with some specimens over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030227120000/http://www.thejump.net/id/oarfish.htm">fifteen meters</a> have been claimed. The oarfish is a deep-water fish, which normally lives on strained plankton and only surfaces when sick or dead. It is often thought that ancient maritime legends of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030227120000/http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/aquatic_animals/91666">sea serpents</a> originate from rare sightings of oarfish. Because the oarfish looks like a snake, it was always assumed that it moved like a snake in water as well. Recently, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030227120000/http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/PAO/oarfish.rm">video footage</a> of the oarfish proves otherwise.
