 is for all intents and purposes the inventor
of the modern hard-boiled detective story.  His
prose is sparse, hard, and perfectly terse.  Although he was most
well known for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000419120000/http://www.voicenet.com/~bmurray/mf_faq.html">The Maltese Falcon</a>, he thought
