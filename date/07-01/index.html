        <div class="content">Because humans and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> share roughly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homininae">99%</a> of their DNA (this number is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=129726">in question</a>), it is believed by some that these two species can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee">crossbreed.</a> The resulting theoretical hybrid would be called a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.rotten.com/library/cryptozoology/humanzee/">humanzee.</a> There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://utopianfederation.20m.com/oliver.htm">rumors</a> of humanzees, but no hard evidence. In the 70's and 80's, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.n2.net/prey/bigfoot/creatures/olivera.htm">unique</a> chimpanzee named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.parascope.com/en/cryptozoo/missingLinks10.htm">Oliver</a> was believed to be a humanzee: he preferred to walk completely upright, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.n2.net/prey/bigfoot/creatures/dna.htm">drink and smoke,</a> had an odd smell that was considered neither human nor chimpanzee, lack of hair on his head and humanlike facial features. A recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.n2.net/prey/bigfoot/creatures/oliveru.htm">test</a> shows that he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.n2.net/prey/bigfoot/creatures/article.htm">genetically a chimpanzee,</a> and is either a new subspecies or a random mutation. And so, while Oliver enjoys the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://robotics.stanford.edu/~oli/oliver.html">golden years</a> of his life, the search for the humanzee -- and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.the-aps.org/publications/tphys/2003html/Oct03/randall.htm">ethical</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.scienceforums.net/forums/archive/t-3764">ramifications</a> -- continues.

        <div class="content">The largest big cat in the world is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">liger:</a> a hybrid between a lion and a tigress. Ligers tend to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/ligers.html">share</a>  behavioral characteristics of their parent species. Ligers are afflicted with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.sierrasafarizoo.com/animals/liger.htm">giantism,</a> and can reach weights of up to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.tigers-animal-actors.com/about/liger/ligerkrf.JPG">thousand pounds.</a> Male ligers are thus far sterile, although females <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/ligers2.html">can breed.</a> A hybrid between a tiger and a lioness is called a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigon">tigon,</a> and is generally smaller and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/tigons.html">never exceeds</a> the size of its parents. This is because in the lion species, the genes for growth hormones come from the father and genes for growth inhibition come from the mother; in the tiger species this is not the case. This difference is related to the cats' social structure; lions with multiple males in prides have to compete for resources within the womb; thus is it to the father's advantage to have large children and it is in the mother's interest to limit the growth for genetic diversity. Tigers, who are solitary, are under pressure to have as many children as possible; thus it is to the father's advantage to have many, equally-sized cubs. The mother doesn't need to inhibit growth. Mixing and matching genes results in a condition called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://members.aol.com/jshartwell/hybrid-bigcats.html"><i>growth dysplasia</i>,</a> hence the giantism of ligers and dwarfism of tigons. The relations of gene expression to social behavior is part of the reason why it is difficult to breed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701120000/http://www.messybeast.com/giantcats.html">giant domestic cats.</a></div>
