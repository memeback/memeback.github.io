        <div class="content">The "it's free but we spam you" business model
seems to be getting popular.  Two examples
are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000113120000/http://freedsl.com/">freeDSL.com</a>, a company
that gives you free DSL access but which displays
targeted ads in a small window while online; and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000113120000/http://www.free-pc.com/">free-PC</a>, which gives
you a (you guessed it!) free PC in exchange for
piping advertisement directly to your brain.  Unfortunately,
to take advantage of these offers you have to be willing
to cripple your machine by running a certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000113120000/http://www.microsoft.com/windows">
successful yet oft-disparaged operating system</a>.
