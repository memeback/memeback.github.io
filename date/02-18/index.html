It's essentially a new form of data mining...a sort of big-picture analysis of huge sections of web-space. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000218120000/http://www.etxtreme.ru/showroom/e-sample.html">output sample</a> is somewhat perplexing upon first glance, but this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000218120000/http://www.etxtreme.ru/headquarters/eMedia/presskit/index.html">press release</a> should help to clarify things a bit.  And once I saw the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000218120000/http://www.etxtreme.ru/headquarters/esources.html">list of sources</a> that Etxtreme sifts through, it seemed interesting enough that I signed up for the mailings.
