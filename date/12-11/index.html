        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981211120000/http://www.howifoundfreedom.com/">How
I Found Freedom in an Unfree World</a> is back 
in print.  Written in the heady hippie days of 
1972 by a guy who went on to make a living 
teaching people how to get rich off the Federal
Reserve's demolition of the US dollar in the
1970s, this book stands head and shoulders above
its cohorts in the self-help genre.

perhaps best demonstrated in the names we inflict on our children.  The 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981211120000/http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> has thoughtfully provided
us with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981211120000/http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/note139/note139.html">list</a> of 
the top ten male and female names in the United States since 1880, as well as other useless 
but potentially humor-worthy information, such as informing idiotic family members that
"Taylor" isn't quite as original as they thought it was, or that when little Michael gets to 
kindergarten, all his friends will have the same name, and the teacher will have to tattoo numbers 
on their foreheads to tell them apart.</div>
