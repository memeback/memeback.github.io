        <div class="content">According to UN estimates, the human population will reach six billion on October 12, 1999. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991011120000/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/stott2/population.html">World Population Clock</a> counts down (or up, as it were) to six billion. Hardcore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991011120000/http://www.pbs.org/kqed/population_bomb/">eco-activists</a> are using 10-12-99 as a mediagenic opportunity to voice their concerns - but not everyone believes that six billion humans is bad news. Population researcher Frank Furedi's informative essay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991011120000/http://www.informinc.co.uk/LM/LM124/LM124_Furedi.html">Six Billion People? Three Cheers</a> offers an optimistic alternative to the grim Malthusian perspective we hear so much about.
