      <h2>1999</h2>

      <article>
        <div class="content">The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990317120000/http://www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids/safe.html">CIA Kids
Page</a> introduces the youth of America to 
espionage and counterterrorism in a freakishly
low-impact fashion.  The site does have a 
link to the excellent resource
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990317120000/http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html">
CIA World Factbook</a>, but the highlight
of any visit are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990317120000/http://www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids/dogs/index.html">
cute doggies</a>, who can sniff out plastic explosives 
and dismember foreign dignitaries.  Other government agencies,
including the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990317120000/http://www.fbi.gov/kids/kids.htm">FBI</a>,
are building equally strange kids pages.  Regrettably, 
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990317120000/http://www.nsa.gov/">NSA's</a> page
doesn't have a children's section.  It probably 
would have cost more than the $4.37 they apparently
alloted for web design.
