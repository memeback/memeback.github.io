        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000901120000/http://www.admworld.com/">Archer Daniels Midland</a> (ADM) the international agricultural-products giant, is probably best known to most people by its "Supermarket to the World" ads. More than a multibillion-dollar food producer, ADM was ringleader in a 1995 worldwide price-rigging scheme that resulted in over $70 million of fines. While corporate skullduggery is depressingly common, ADM's case was unusual: a senior ADM executive VP agreed to become a undercover witness, and recorded boardroom deals for the FBI for almost a year before the firm was charged.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000901120000/http://www.informantbook.com/">The Informant</a>, a facinating chronicle of corporate greed and James-Bond antics of ADM's wire-wearing VP, reads more like a high-wire, double-dealing, dirty-tricks spy story than the nonfiction account it is.
