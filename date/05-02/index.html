        <div class="content">Despite the best intentions of your parents, teachers and school administrators, school often amounts to a cross between a prison and a wage-slave indoctrination center.  Even those who perform well in school are saddled with a lifelong, toxic addiction to external validation.  Don't surrender your childhood so easily!  If you find school limiting, I urge you to explore the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://www.midnightbeach.com/hs/">"unschooling"</a> (or "homeschooling") movement. An excellent starting place is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962959170" target="_top">The Teenage Liberation Handbook; How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education</a>, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://hometown.aol.com/gracejanet/index.html" target="_top">Grace Llewellyn</a>.

Usually there are beats, but often they are a bit too disjointed for dancing. And, it's not all just Autechre and F.S.O.L. For example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://www.underjord.net/saundart/">Saundart Recordings</a> releases some vinyl and CDRs that are given descriptions as strange as song titles and band names. If you find this intriguing, read through posts at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://idm.atonal.org/">IDM Newsbase</a>. Recent postings toss out such things as links to IDM <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://www.skimo.com/ie/skimonet.htm">labels and distributors</a>, or the fascinating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000502120000/http://www.daytonasystems.com/carth/"> Richard D.
