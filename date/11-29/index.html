        <div class="content">Shameful confession:  I am addicted to reading other
people's journals.  It helps satisfy my voyeuristic 
tendencies.  I think I was turned on to it by following 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://www.omnigroup.com/~cirocco">Kim Rollins'</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://www.omnigroup.com/~cirocco/snp/">online diaries</a> (as well as the subsequent

see how quality of writing matters:  some people can make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://opalcat.livejournal.com/">what should be interesting seem
boring</a>, and others can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://www.dorkist.com/">make the mundane seem vibrant</a>.
While you can always cheap out and get a fix
of journaley goodness at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a> (contest: can you find mine?),
there is something special about stumbling upon a homepage with a journal
during an unrelated websearch.  In that vein, I present 
today's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001129120000/http://gurlpages.com/swandive/main.html">little diamond in the rough</a>.  And I didn't
