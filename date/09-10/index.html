"Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.geocities.com/swish413.geo/swish2.html">Star Wars sucks</a> more."

"Yeah, right!  Off the top of my head I know of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.geocities.com/starwarsaddon/betterthantrek.html">10 reasons why it's better</a>."

"What?!  No way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/">this fancy writer dude even said Star Trek was better</a>."

"Ok, I was wrong: there are actually

"Shut up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/daffnie/list.html">Star Trek's better</a>."

"I bet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.grudge-match.com/History/ds-enterprise.shtml">the Death Star would kick the Enterprise's ass</a>."

"Well, I know for a fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.angelfire.com/art/glorious/vader.html">Mr. Spock could take Darth Vader</a>."

"Come on, at the very least, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.daltonator.net/fanfics/serious/red_storm.htm">a stormtrooper would annihilate a redshirt Ensign's ass</a>."

"Well, okay.  But, we both still agree that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.furryconflict.com/">furries</a> suck, right?"

"Yes.  Especially if they're <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020910120000/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2002/01/09/lotr_starwars/">hobbits</a>."</div>
