(people putting their cats on flatbed scanners).
Naturally, because most everyone on the net is a

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990725120000/http://www.eskimo.com/~gburlin/restore/">Derrick Townsend's page</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990725120000/http://www.normpdx.org/links.html">
National Organization of Restoring Men</a> are probably the best starting point on your journey to the un-cut.
 Generally you can choose between outpatient surgery or DIY non-surgical methods such as
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990725120000/http://www.eskimo.com/~gburlin/restore/uncirc.txt">stretching</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990725120000/http://www.jkcc.com/manhood/">prosthesis</a>.
