Some prophetic soul had searched for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991118120000/http://search.go2net.com/crawler?general=robotech&amp;method=0&amp;target=Â®ion=0&amp;timeout=0&amp;sort=0&amp;refer=mc-search">"Robotech"</a>. 
At first click to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991118120000/http://robotech.simplenet.com/">The Robotech Page</a>, I thought it was just another
weenie site filled with useless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991118120000/http://robotech.simplenet.com/fanfic.htm">fan fiction</a> and other such drivel, only dedicated
to the bastardized american animated series that I was most fond of in my youth.
Once
I clicked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991118120000/http://robotech.simplenet.com/eps/">here</a>, I knew divine intervention had brought me to this
page. All of the Robotech episodes, Macross, Southern Cross,
Next Generation, and even the strangley begotten Sentinels series are
available online in realvideo. Thanks be to Zor!</div>
