        <div class="content">Television spinoffs are one thing, but a fictional universe that contains multiple shows is another. NBC is a good example: Kramer from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://us.imdb.com/Title?0098904">Seinfeld</a> is the landlord of Paul Buckman (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://us.imdb.com/Trivia?0103484">Mad About You</a>)'s bachelor apartment; Ursula from Mad About You is the twin sister of Phoebe from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/primetime/pt1120.php">Friends.</a> In addition, Urkel from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/primetime/pt1096.php">Family Matters</a> (itself a spinoff of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/primetime/pt1107.php">Perfect Strangers</a>) crashed a jet back into the cast of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://us.imdb.com/Title?0101205">Step By Step</a> -- one of whose characters, Dana, made an appearance on the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020621120000/http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/primetime/pt1113.php">Boy Meets World.</a> While the obvious motive for such connections is increased marketshare (after all, link a new series to a known good one to increase brand recognition), it's amusing that the linking series almost always outlive the linked ones.
