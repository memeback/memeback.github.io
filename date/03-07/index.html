        <div class="content">When it comes to keeping children from accessing potentially inappropriate internet content, most internet users agree that individual parental use of filtration programs would be preferable to the onus of government policing. But it's nowhere near an ideal solution, due to long-standing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020307120000/http://www.eff.org/Publications/Declan_McCullagh/cwd.keys.to.the.kingdom.0796.article">concerns about the agendas</a> of some censorware companies, as well as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020307120000/http://peacefire.org/censorware/Cyber_Patrol/jan-2002-blocks.shtml">unintentional blockage</a> of sites usually considered "family-safe" by unintelligent filtration algorithms. What's more, at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020307120000/http://peacefire.org/bypass/">censorware disabler</a> exists.  Perhaps there's no answer in sight, but if you want a more intensive (and less realistic) approach, there's always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020307120000/http://deekoo.net/eye/">Guardian 2000</a>.</div>

        <div class="content">If you really like playing laser tag, and are somewhat of an
electronics genius, you can do what Light Brain Productions
did and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050307120000/http://www.lasertagparts.com/mtdesign.htm">design and build
your own</a>.  
The "MilesTag" system uses 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050307120000/http://www.lasertagparts.com/mtformat.htm">custom digital signalling</a>,
which allows up to 32 players on
seven different teams and supports a wide range of scalable, fully
configurable weapons, including sniper rifles, mines and "area-denial"
ordinance.
