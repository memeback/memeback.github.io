the 70s, examples that went oddly, and endearingly, awry. Don't forget to study the relationship between loose underwear and celery in

        <div class="content">Depending on your point-of-view, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://www.dogme95.dk/">Dogme95</a> is one of the most
exciting or most pretentious new movements in world cinema.  Based on strict adherence to
a "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://www.dogme95.dk/the_vow/vow.html">Vow of Chastity</a>" which limit story and technical aspects of the film,
the four Danes who founded
Dogme95 in 1995 wish to counter many modern tendencies in film.  It's not yet been officially
recognized as a Dogme95 film, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://members.aol.com/FilmKorine/korine.html">Harmony Korine</a>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://www.juliendonkey-boy.com/">Julien Donkey-Boy</a>
is generally considered the first American foray into Dogme movies.  (However, this won't be
the last, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://directorsworld.com/.getarticle/.519306332">a recent interview</a> -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://www.dogme95.dk/menu/menuset.htm">which was very possibly faked</a> -- indicates that even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000205120000/http://www.spielberg-dreamworks.com/">
Steven Spielberg</a> might make be making a Dogme95 movie sometime soon).</div>
