      <article>
        <div class="content">As a pet owner, you know how much joy and pleasure can be found in the company of animals. Perhaps your empathy for animal life runs deep enough for you to adopt a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.vrg.org/">vegetarian lifestyle</a>. Good for you! So why are you still buying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.purina.com/">conventional pet food</a>? Sure, many people dismiss the idea of dogs and cats adopting a vegetarian diet as "unnatural." But consider: is it any more "natural" for dogs and cats to eat the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.blarg.net/~critter/articles/ngo/food1.htm">ground-up remains</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.factoryfarming.com/">factory-farmed meat</a> deemed "unfit for human consumption," like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.factoryfarming.com/gallery/photos_downer.htm">dying, diseased or downed cattle</a>? Perhaps you might consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.naturalchoice.net/sec4/petfood.htm">healthier, cruelty-free alternatives</a>. Take a look beyond <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.safeway.com/corp_home.asp">commercial supermarkets</a> and you will discover an entire industry catering to the meatless diets of both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.wow-bow.com/index.html">dogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.vegancats.com/">cats</a>.
Unfortunately, most of the web resources used by Veterinarians are fee-based (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.vin.com/">VIN</a>), precluding links to articles in the formal literature that outline the impact of imposing a vegetarian diet on carnivorous and omnivorous animals.  Cat owners take note: one responsible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.vegsoc.org/">vegetarian organization</a> has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010328120000/http://www.vegsoc.org/info/catfood.html">article</a> urging those thinking about a vegetarian diet for their cat to reconsider.
