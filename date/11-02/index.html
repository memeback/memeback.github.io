Dogma is a religious comedy, that pokes fun at almost everything 
Catholics hold dear, but is ultimately pro-faith (Smith is actually a 
devout Catholic).  Which is why it's ironic that you can read 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991102120000/http://www.dogma-movie.com/hate/indexnf.html">hate mail</a>
from people who have never seen the movie, probably because their
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991102120000/http://www.catholicleague.org/">superiors</a> told them to,
and who are they to question authority?
