Take, for instance, the history of jazz organ music, which is exhaustively detailed at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010129120000/http://www.jwolf.com/iajo/iajo.htm">International Archives for the Jazz Organ</a>.

Chicago station WNUR has a useful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010129120000/http://www.wnur.org/jazz/styles/">music map/flow chart</a> on the evolution of jazz as well as a useful and simple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010129120000/http://www.wnur.org/jazz/artists">list of jazz musicians</a>, which includes most of the major players in current and modern jazz, a number of entries which have their own links to more in depth information.
