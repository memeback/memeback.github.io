teach English ("spread the English virus"), pay off his student loans, and buy a jetpack.  Author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/http://www.yip.org/jim/">Jim Munroe</a> (formerly editor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/http://www.adbusters.org/">Adbusters</a>) is doing some interesting things with the production and distribution of the novel: he's giving away the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/http://www.yip.org/jim/Download.htm">complete text as freeware</a>, selling copies of it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/https://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/r1.cgi?ELQ&amp;S&amp;lang=en">through kagi.com</a> ($14US, $20CAN), and exhorting others to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/http://www.yip.org/jim/YouShouldMain.htm">self-publish their own books</a>.  As of yesterday, Jim said that only a few copies had sold through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000612120000/http://www.kagi.com/">kagi.com</a>, through which he pockets about 70% of the cover price.

Amazon (I won't even provide a link) -- where self-publishers like Jim end up with only about 30% of the cover price in their pockets. </div>
