        <div class="content"> In the insane world where venture-cash-rich internet firms are
knocking over each other to give away free stuff in order to build market share, the only competitive 
advantage a startup has is its ability to give away the house faster than its rivals. 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990916120000/http://www.ureach.com/">uReach.com</a> could very well be the winner of this bizzare
race, offering webmail, a personal 800-number voicemail box and inbound fax capacities for anyone 
who logs in. Since its ability to financially sustain itself on pure advertising revenue is laughable, 
I suspect they're trolling to get acquired.
