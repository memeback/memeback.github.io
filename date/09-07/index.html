        <div class="content"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070907120000/http://www.grandin.com/index.html">Temple Grandin</a>, a doctor of animal science, devotes her life to designing more humane abbatoirs. That site is a treasure trove of information on both animal behavior as well as humane ways of dispatching them in ways that conform with modern technology and religious restrictions. <i>And</i> she is autistic, to boot. Her essay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070907120000/http://www.grandin.com/welfare/animals.are.not.things.html">"Animals are Not Things"</a> is a good way of showing that one can care about animal welfare and still enjoy eating them.
