      <article>
        <div class="content">A couple of weeks back, I wrote an article about Karyn Bosnak.  In case you don't recall that article, Ms. Bosnak earned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/10/02/karyn/index_np.html">her 15 minutes of fame</a> by creating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.savekaryn.com/">a website</a> which asked us, the cyberpublic, to pay off the credit card debt she had accumulated living in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.corcoran.com/">a posh apartment in Midtown Manhattan</a> and buying herself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.vivre.com/index.jsp">luxury goods</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.bloomingdales.com/">Bloomingdales</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/Entry.jsp?isNS=0">Saks Fifth Avenue</a>.  When she was unexpectedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/bank/bt0204.html">laid off like many other New Yorkers</a> (many of whom shop only at places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.target.com/">Target</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.payless.com/">Payless Shoe Source</a>) in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.mckinsey.com/knowledge/articles/ImpactofAttack.asp">the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York</a>, Bosnak had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.kidsbank.com/">no savings</a> and no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/waiter/waiter.html">way to pay the bills</a> she'd shortsightedly run up and looked to us to bail her out like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/PA00Aes.html">Chrysler in 1979</a>.  Although it's very hard for most people to come up with any sympathy for anybody who has amassed US$20 thousand worth of credit card debt buying Gucci and Fendi products, surprisingly, we did.. to the tune of just over US$13 thousand.  (Admittedly, we even contributed to her popularity by posting her site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://memepool.com/Search/index.cgi?terms=racked">here</a>.)  Now, Karyn's got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030103120000/http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/store.aspx?s=savekaryn">a merchandising deal</a>, a book deal, and a movie deal in the works.
