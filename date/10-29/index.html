        <div class="content">I have religiously grovelled the MOD newsgroups for years, and every
couple months a new cover of the song "Popcorn" arrives in my spool.
The last time this happened, I decided to make a web page with all the
different "Popcorn" songs I could find.  While researching for the
project, I discovered that someone already has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991029120000/http://www.cam.org/~lafranc/popcorn/">a site dedicated to
"Popcorn"</a>.  As of this writing, there are 69 different versions

The Talented Mr. Ripley</a> is one of the most disturbing yet mesmerizing books I've read. Starring a 
brilliant sociopath as its protagonist, the story rides the edge of macabre as only a well-told story through the eyes of a 
human predator can. Apparently, Miramax/Paramount Pictures has been busy shooting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991029120000/http://www.talentedmrripley.com/">movie version</a> to be released this winter - but fans of psychological thrillers should
still read the book before you go to the theater. </div>
