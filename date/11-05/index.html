        <div class="content">In a world filled with sitcoms whose plot every week could be described by "something happens and then zany hilarity ensues," there is a tendency to try and break the "sitcom" mold completely like 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991105120000/http://www.allymcbeal.com/">Ally McBeal</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991105120000/http://www.abc.com/primetime/sports_night/">SportsNight</a>, but there is one show which shows that strong character driven comedy can still thrive in a situation comedy framework.
That show would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991105120000/http://www.cosby.com/">Cosby</a>.  It features Bill Cosby as a retired baggage handler.  The cast includes one of my very favorite actors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991105120000/http://www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/primetime/shows/cosby/castbios/ddoug.shtml">Doug E. Doug</a>, plus
Phylicia Rashad, Madeline Kahn, and T'Keyah Crystal Keymah.  It even has my favorite comedic actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991105120000/http://www.icomm.ca/ifoa/ifoa97/shawn.html">Wallace Shawn</a> in a recurring minor role.
