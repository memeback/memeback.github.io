      <h2>2000</h2>

      <article>
        <div class="content">Why is listening to audiobooks on your Rio player so painful?  Partially it's the user-hostile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000514120000/http://www.audible.com/">Audible.com</a> website (e.g., you need to wade through several pages of "I agree to receive spam" before they'll even relinquish a sample).  But mostly it's because Usability and Avoiding Legal Accountability are contradictory goals.  See, Diamond Multimedia created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000514120000/http://www.rioport.com/">Rioport.com</a> in early '99 as the dedicated support site for the Rio players.  Enter lots of lawsuits involving the illegal distribution of MP3s, for which Diamond made the leading portable player <strong>and</strong> operated an MP3 distribution website - any copyright lawyer would advise them to split their concerns into separate legal entities, each of which could claim that piracy is someone else's fault.  Not surprisingly, Diamond (now a division of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000514120000/http://www.s3.com/">S3</a>) spun off RioPort, Inc. in October.  The downside for the user is that although they theoretically have a new support site (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000514120000/http://www.riohome.com/">RioHome.com</a>, which still clumsily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000514120000/http://www.riohome.com/default.asp?menu=RIO_500&amp;sub_menu=PARTNERS">refers to itself as Rioport</a>), people visiting RioPort seeking the support promised in the software and manual are left in the cold.
