        <div class="content">My favorite radio station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000716120000/http://www.wfmu.org/">WFMU</a> is the long time host of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000716120000/http://www.incorrectmusic.com/">Incorrect Music Hour,</a> a show dedicated to archiving obscure, underfinanced, and shut-in artists. As host Irwin Chusid would descibe it "A true 'Incorrect' artist must be sincere and lack self-awareness. A severe irony deficiency helps. Any humorous overtones to their work must be unintentional." Other exciting developments include a companion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000716120000/http://www.incorrectmusic.com/projects/keyofz.php3">book and CD,</a> which focuses on some of the the show's better finds.
