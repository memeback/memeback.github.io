in a nutshell: Xylitol, a sweetener primarily rendered from birch
pulp, is undigestible by most mouth bacteria.  It has the same
sweetness per calorie as sucrose.  It increases saliva pH above its
normal 7.0, precipitating the absorption of calcium by tooth enamel.
The World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration
agree that it's a safe sweetener.  It even can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010513120000/http://www.xylitol.org/drwilliams.htm">reduce your chance of
getting ear and throat infections</a>.  It has no icky aftertaste, and
it doesn't leave nasty residue in your brain.  It's not even a sugar!
So why in the nine billion names of God can't you get xylitol gum in a
random U.S. grocery store?  For crying out loud, people, even
Canadians have this stuff!</div>
