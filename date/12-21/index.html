        <div class="content">Former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> funny lady <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011221120000/http://www.victoriajackson.com/">Victoria Jackson</a> is best remembered for her Betty Boop voice, wacky poetry, and predilection for handstands. Skim her Web site and you will discover she is also an accomplished ukuleleist, comic songwriter, and, surprisingly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011221120000/http://www.victoriajackson.com/bibleverses.html">more Christian than the Church Lady</a> (though less obnoxious about it).
