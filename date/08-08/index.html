It is due to be launched in 2003 and passively orbit the Earth for 50 000 years before returning to the planet (they've put some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010808120000/http://www.keo.org/uk/faq.html#faq6">thought</a> into that part). The design includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010808120000/http://www.keo.org/uk/faq.html#faq20">wings</a> that "flap" (courtesy of high tech shape memory alloys and heat from the sun).
