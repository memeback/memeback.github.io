        <div class="content">The commercial and critical success of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041124120000/http://www.bmwfilms.com/">BMW Films</a> spawned a raft of imitation projects from their competitors, most notable of which is Mercedes-Benz who hired Michael Mann and Benicio Del Toro to film a 'trailer' for the nonexistent film 'Lucky Star' (for inexplicable reasons, the movie files and web presence of Lucky Star have been removed since early 2003, but copies can still be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041124120000/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=lucky+star+download+mercedes&amp;btnG=Search">found via google</a>)<br><br>

Encouraged by the enthusiastic response and buzz from the online community, Mercedes continued to bankroll indie-film projects and recently released the haunting and whimsical short film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041124120000/http://www.the-porter.com/">The Porter</a>, starring British actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041124120000/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066586/">Max Beesley</a> and Hungarian beauty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041124120000/http://www.lamodels.com/LAM_Women/AnnaMaC/anna_a.htm">Anna Maria Cseh</a>.</div>
