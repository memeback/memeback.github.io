        <div class="content">It's somehow strange being in a rural area, and having the road suddenly widen out as if there were an interchange,
but instead find myself crossing a bridge over something resembling a pasture - there were animals grazing on it!
But this pasture looked a lot like an expressway, so I followed it one way and the other, and figured out 
approximately what the intent had been. After a bit of research, I found that
it  as an abortive attempt at an expressway, now locally known derisively as the "goat path". 
The problems which led to it still exists, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990614120000/http://www.co.lancaster.pa.us/">Lancaster County</a>

        <div class="content">Web designers often lay out a page with dummy content, show it to the client for style approval, and then input in the client's material. The dummy content, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diem nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut lacreet dolore magna aliguam erat volutpat,"
(a meaningless string of Latin gibberish), has been the standard text in printing and publishing circles for decades. <br>What's hysterical is the number of designers who forget to replace their dummy titles with the client's title before delivering the site.
