        <div class="content">"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990527120000/http://www.fair.org/">FAIR</a> is the national media watch group that offers well-documented criticism of media bias and censorship."
 Most of their coverage deals with stories that are neglected or outright rejected by the editors and advertisors in newspapers, television and radio.
 They publish a printed bimonthly magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990527120000/http://www.fair.org/extra/index.html">EXTRA!</a>, and have a weekly radio show
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990527120000/http://www.webactive.com/webactive/cspin/">CounterSpin</a> that is aired on many local radio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990527120000/http://www.fair.org/counterspin/stations.html">
stations</a>. For example: Why you should be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990527120000/http://www.foxbghsuit.com/">afraid</a> of milk containing Bovine Growth Hormones
