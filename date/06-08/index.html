        <div class="content">Many of us in the field of Computer Science have
wondered why it is that there are so few female
computer scientists.  Well,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990608120000/http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/ellens/Gender/pap/pap.html">here</a>
is a very insightful paper on that topic.  It
was written in 1991 by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990608120000/http://www.mills.edu/ACAD_INFO/mcs_spertus.html">Ellen Spertus</a>, now an assistant professor 
of Computer Science at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990608120000/http://www.mills.edu/">Mills College</a>,
but little enough has changed in the eight years since, that it is
still very topical.  She has also provided us with an
excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990608120000/http://www.mills.edu/ACAD_INFO/MCS/SPERTUS/Gender/gender.html">page of links on that same topic</a>
