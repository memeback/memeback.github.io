        <div class="content">My latest boy toy is the brand-new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990914120000/http://www.sega.com/console/index.shtml">Dreamcast</a>
from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990914120000/http://www.sega.com/">Sega</a>.  Roughly
as powerful (in gaming terms) as a PC with the 
latest 3d cards, it costs a mere $199.  So far my favorite
games have to be the psychotically realistic
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990914120000/http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/reviews/10960.html">NFL 2k</a>
and the perfect arcade conversion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990914120000/http://www.soulcalibur.com/">Soul Calibur</a>.  Lastly,
the unit comes with a built in 56k modem and a web browser
disk -- and yes, you can read memepool on it.</div>
